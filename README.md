_This project uses Xcode to support its PocketShpinx library, and you will need that installed before you can use this project._

# To initialize the entire project:
```console
sh start.sh
```
This script will check for both Homebrew and PocketSphinx on your computer. It will download Homebrew if it doesnt exist, and download PocketSphinx and its dependencies via Homebrew.

# Click Record:

And pick any of the commands available. _Say "List Commands" to get a full list of commands available._

### Your terminal contains all logged output from the serverside, such as API success/fail information, as well as routes traversed to get such information:

### The KIFT application itself will also log less detailed information. It will only log such things as "Turning Lights Off" or "Playing Music"
